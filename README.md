# Numerical Analysis
This repository contains my codes for the course Numerical Analysis in 2019.\
The projects are as the following:
- Euler Method
- Corrected Euler Method
- Runge Phenomenon
- Runge Kutta Method
- Bezier Curve Drawer which was inspired by a basic code provided by the instructor. The assignment involved drawing a teardrop and a duck.
- Curve fitting on given data
